# react-native-solitaire
A pure javascript solitaire UI for React Native framework.

##Disclaimer
This game is not functional. This was intended for practice with PanResponder animations. I might add it sometime in the future, but if anyone wants to contribute and make it functional, feel free to submit a pull request.
